## A brief introduction
I'm a software engineer currently finishing the last semester of my BS in Computer Science at San Francisco State University. I'm also a musician, playing bass and guitar in three bands. When I'm not building cool things or playing music, I'm probably nerding out on politics, pizza, and Star Wars.
