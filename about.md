## A brief introduction
I'm a software engineer at [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com), based in San Francisco, California. I'm also a musician, playing bass and guitar in multiple bands and sometimes other things too. When I'm not building cool things or playing music, I'm probably nerding out on politics, pizza, and Star Wars.
