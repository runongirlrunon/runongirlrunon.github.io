Welcome to my new blog, website, portfolio... whatever this might turn into. My plan here is to showcase my projects, mostly, but also to post the fun things I learn about Ruby, Rails, Git, or, I don't know, maybe I'll develop some unlikely passion for PHP along the way.

To start things off, here's a few blog posts I've written for Grand Rounds, the healthcare company I've been working for since May 2016.

- On the Engineering blog, [Wayback Machine: Learning to Sight Along the Space Capsule](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216122447/http://eng.grandrounds.com/blog/2016/12/29/testing-against-external-services/). Inspired by Sandi Metz's RailsConf 2013 [talk on unit testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M), I reworked one of our service's test suites that had been increasingly slowing down, improving its run time from ~3 minutes down to ~6 seconds.
- Also on the Engineering blog, [Wayback Machine: Burying Your Dead Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20180703020715/http://eng.grandrounds.com/blog/2017/01/24/burying-your-dead-code/). Or, how I used `git bisect` to track down dead code in one of our main app's Models.
- On the company news blog, I detailed a recent foray into leading a project in my post [Tearing Down Barriers to Health Care Access Requires Focus on Minority Groups](https://news.grandrounds.com/blog/tearing-down-barriers-to-health-care-access-requires-focus-on-minority-groups/).

In my next couple posts, I'll expound on some projects I've worked on at school, such as the hackathon my team *Moon Latency* won in April, and my brief experience as the "CEO of a small startup," *Warehaus Media*.
