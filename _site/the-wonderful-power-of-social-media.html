<p>Dear Lindsey,</p>

<p>Hearing from a person who appreciates the music you wrote years ago is like running into an old friend.  Thank you!</p>

<p>I’m attaching some sheet music for you.  Of course, the music I’ve written in the past several years is different in many ways from my earlier music, so I will also send you a video of a piece I wrote for my wife, Karen Lorraine.  It’s called “My Sweet Lorraine.”</p>

<p>I hope you keep playing and creating!  Best wishes, and thanks again for your incredible support.</p>

<p>Peace and love,</p>

<p>Jeffrey David</p>

<p>Hello Jeffrey David,</p>

<p>I’ve been meaning to respond all week but this one has been pretty tough. Hence, I cannot express how absolutely joyed I am to receive this email. Let me tell you a bit of the saga I’ve gone through the last few years; I’m sure you’ll appreciate it:</p>

<p>A few years ago, I finally acquired an electric piano. I’d grown up playing an upright my parents bought for me to learn on, but after moving out I never had the space for a keyboard. I asked my mom if she still had all the books I used to have when I was younger, and she said they’d either ended up with a family member or donated somewhere. I didn’t mind because I could always find the books again, or so I thought. There was one I sort of remembered the name of but couldn’t find it for the life of me; it had a song in it called “Cambria” but I couldn’t recall the composer’s name either. I thought the book was called “Keyboard Classics” and had a rainbow on the front, but all the googling of every combination of words I could think of just led me to modern tabs from a band called “Coheed and Cambria.” Not quite right.</p>

<p>So, I tried several times over the last few years to track this book down or the song or anything about it, but nothing ever came up. Then, a couple weeks ago, I tried posting again on Reddit about it and finally SOMEONE FOUND THE BOOK. After finding the title, “The Spectrum Collection of Colorful Keyboard Classics,”  I managed to track down someone selling both volumes on Amazon. One of the listings (volume II) had a typed-out list of the songs, some of which were absolutely familiar, but nowhere did I see the name “Cambria.” I wrote to the Amazon seller asking if they could send me photos of the song indexes in both books. While waiting for a response, I kept going back to the listing, trying to see if anything could jog my memory… and finally it clicked. Jeffrey David Hooven! So, I went googling again, found some random archive of Instagram posts that lead me to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqyfTYjHaUg/?igshid=u79ew092dbv1">video of the woman playing “Morning Meditation.”</a> That song was definitely familiar, and that’s when I figured out that your daughter’s name was Cambria, so I figured I was just mixing up pieces of memories. Hence, I reached out, thinking I had found the song…</p>

<p>Then your email showed up.</p>

<p>I sat down and played “Cambria” tonight twice in a row for the first time in probably 15 years. This was an absolutely special moment to experience after a years-long search for this piece of music. Playing piano has always been so dear to me, as it’s one of the ways my grandmother and I bonded when I was young–she was my first teacher, and I will always cherish the memories of sitting at her baby grand trying to access the talent I inherited from her.</p>

<p>This has been one of the hardest weeks I’ve ever gone through, but this moment changed it for the better in so many ways.</p>

<p>Thank you. So so so much.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>

<p>Lindsey Anne</p>
